# Bludit-3.9.2_Bruteforce_Bypass
A Python3 script to bypass Bludit 3.9.2 bruteforce protection.

Simply specify the list of usernames at ***un_wordlist_file = <filename.txt>***.

And the list of passwords at ***pw_wordlist_file = <filename.txt>***.

The script makes use of arrays resulting in higher effiency and thus bruteforcing faster.
